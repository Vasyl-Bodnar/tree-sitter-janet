# tree-sitter-janet

Personal tree-sitter grammar for Janet language.

Currently, it only supports basic syntax highlighting. 
Further improvements and cleanup are planned.

Mostly based on the PEG from [docs](https://janet-lang.org/docs/syntax.html).

## Note

While there is a basic highlighter in queries/, 
you may wish to modify it to suit your needs.
